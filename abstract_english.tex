Many establishments are growing in size, and to offer customers of these establishments (such as higher learning institutions, hospitals, shopping malls and airports) an indoor mapping solution, will likely induce added value, reduce the number of late appointments, improve the experience of students and improve overall employee, patient, visitor and personnel experience \cite{mazemap22015}. This report aims to ascertain whether a freemium model will work in the context of a B2B\&C market, and as a method of determining this a survey will be presented.

The survey was answered by 14 respondents, including an interview conducted via telephone. 50\% of respondents cited price as a barrier to acquiring an indoor mapping system, while 66,7\% cited demand as a limiting factor. That is not to say however, that a general disinterest was shown, as most respondents were positively inclined towards paying for additional paid services.
