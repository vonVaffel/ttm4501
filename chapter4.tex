\chapter{Chapter 4 - The Freemium Model in Indoor Maps Survey - Results}
This chapter aims to present the results of the survey to the reader, and the questions and the respective responses will be presented here.
A total of 14 respondents of the survey submitted answers, and in total 60 institutions were contacted. This leads to a response rate of $23.3\%$. 
\section{Respondents}
Several respondents indicated that they were some sort of leading figure; headmasters at HEIs and building- and operations managers. Given the anonymity of the survey, only four respondents chose to specify who they represented and their current position. In the case of hospitals, the invitation letter sent through e-mail was sent to all eligible receivers which meant that personnel that would not be qualified to answer the survey, received the letter. This was unintentional from the surveyor's point of view and was further clarified in the proceeding invitation letters.

\section{Current Indoor Mapping Situation}
Figure \ref{table:questions} presents all questions asked in the survey. In order to obtain a sense of how a customer at the respective institutions would go about and find a desired location the question "At the moment, how can one locate and/or navigate to a desired indoor location?" (Q1) was asked. If choices for the customers turned out to be poor, i.e. only signs, static maps etc., then the respondent would possibly be inclined to acquire an indoor mapping system.
