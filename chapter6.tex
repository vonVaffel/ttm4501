\chapter{Chapter 6 - Results and Discussion}
This chapter will look more closely at the answers provided by respondents from the survey in chapter 4. 
\section{Individual responses}
This section contains individual elaborations in relation to the questions asked in the survey. The reader is referred to chapter 4 for a thorough review of the survey in question.
\subsection{Headmaster of a Norwegian University}
Though short in length, this particular representative already had an existing indoor mapping system (in this case MazeMap) employed at their university. As the survey had mostly optional questions to defer the respondent from potentially not answering at all, some answers where shorter than others, this being a case of this. It was reported however, that the current solution was satisfactory, and that integrated systems in conjunction with an indoor mapping solution was of great use to the university. A point was also made that integration with a calendar was especially important.
\subsection{Headmaster of a Norwegian College}
This college is one of the smaller ones in Norway with around 4000 students and a staff of 300. At the time of the survey, this respondent stated that floor planning were made available on line as the main means of finding a particular indoor location. They didn't employ a indoor mapping system, but they were considering it. Furthermore, they were also positive towards purchasing additional services, and integration with a timetable was their highest ranking value-added service of the five, whilst integration with SMS, own apps and own systems scored low; 1 and 2 respectively.
\subsection{Engineering and Planning Manager of a Norwegian Hospital}
