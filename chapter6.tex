\chapter{Chapter 6 - Concluding Remarks and Further Work}
\section{Concluding Remarks}
This report has investigated whether a freemium model will work in a B2B\&C market. How an indoor mapping service can provide establishments with a freemium service and what it entails has been mapped. This has been done through a survey and an interview. The background stated any potential benefits of a free model, and also described the various caveats of the B2B\&C market; where it differs from B2C where freemium has been established to be a solid business model. It protruded from the survey that demand and price were important factors, with price being the factor most of interest as it would possibly be advantageous when trying to sell a freemium service. With demand as a limiting factor in acquiring an indoor mapping system, it might be harder to argue that a freemium model will solve the problem of customer acquisition, so in this aspect it would be recommended to clearly state the potential benefits an indoor mapping solution might entail to different establishments.


\section{Future Work}
The aspect of demand will be pivotal in order to increase customer acquisition, as price is the main entry barrier readily solved by offering a freemium product. The survey included in this report was being done on a national level, and it would be interesting to see how different countries would reply to the survey questions. Additionally, a sample size of 14 is hardly worthy of a conclusive remark, but given the qualitative nature of some of the questions and the interview done, some insights are expected to be found. A case study of a company that has successfully or otherwise failed to implement a freemium model in the B2B\&C market, would also be highly interesting. Additionally, a business model might be proposed and adjusted according to a non-freemium business model, to better determine the underlying factors that accelerates customer acquisition.
