\noindent This report consists of the preliminary work leading up to the thesis of Master of Science degree in Communication Technology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I have specialised in ICT economics at the Department of Telematics (ITEM), belonging to the Faculty of Information Technology, Mathematics and Electrical Engineering (IME).

I would like to extend gratitude towards my supervisor Thomas Jelle and responsible professor Jan A. Audestad for highly valued input throughout the semester. Lastly, I wish to thank all respondents of the survey, without these answers this report would have been moot.
