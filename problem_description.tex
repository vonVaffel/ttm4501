MazeMap has developed an indoor map and navigation service and in less than 2 years we have helped close to 1 million users find their way. Now we want to help the next Billion. MazeMap has a very scalable technical platform and the main bottle neck achieving our goal is customer acquisition. 

To accelerate customer acquisition we are considering giving away MazeMap map service for free to customers. The free model has worked for numerous start-ups in the consumer market, e.g Skype, Waze and Snapchat, but will it work in a B2B\&C model?

Will a free model accelerate customer acquisition, in other words will e.g Universities want to help their students using MazeMap if they got the service for free or is there other factors more important than price? 

The task is to investigate if a free model will accelerate customer acquisition and if so, how should it be done?
